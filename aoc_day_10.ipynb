    "# You'll need to plug it in. There's only one problem: the charging outlet near your seat produces the wrong number \n",

    "\n",
    "# Each of your joltage adapters is rated for a specific output joltage (your puzzle input). \n",
    "# Any given adapter can take an input 1, 2, or 3 jolts lower than its rating and still produce its rated \n",
    "# output joltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In addition, your device has a built-in joltage adapter rated for 3 jolts higher than the highest-rated \n",
    "# adapter in your bag. (If your adapter list were 3, 9, and 6, your device's built-in adapter would be rated \n",

    "# Similarly, the next choices would need to be the adapter rated 6 and then the adapter rated 7 (with difference of 1\n",
    "# and 1).\n",
    "# The only adapter that works with the 7-jolt rated adapter is the one rated 10 jolts (difference of 3).\n",
